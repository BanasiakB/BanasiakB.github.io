## About Me

I am a passionate mathematician and machine learning engineer with a strong foundation in applied mathematics and a drive to solve real-world problems using data, algorithms, and intelligent systems. My journey spans academic research, hands-on engineering, and consulting ‚Äî all unified by a deep interest in creating practical AI solutions rooted in solid mathematical reasoning.

Currently, I‚Äôm working as an ML Engineer at [Deepsense.ai](https://deepsense.ai/), where I contribute to cutting-edge AI projects, including LLM personalization, drug discovery, retrieval-augmented generation systems and Agentic AI.

## Recent Projects

### üß™ Multimodal LLM for Drug Discovery ‚Äì [Deepsense.ai Case Study](https://deepsense.ai/case-studies/enhancing-in-silico-drug-discovery-with-a-multimodal-llm/)

Contributed to experimental research on integrating Graphormer architectures with multimodal LLMs to enhance molecular understanding in drug discovery pipelines. My role involved running feasibility experiments, testing model training on in-house infrastructure, and supporting foundational research.

### üß† LLM Personalization & Radicalization Detection

Participated in an internal research project focused on exploring self-radicalization and personality adaptation in large language models (LLMs). I was solely responsible for the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including synthetic dataset generation, model training, experiment design, and optimization. The evaluation pipeline integrated a variety of techniques such as embedding distance metrics, LLM-based classification, and LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. I also developed specialized tools, including a speech destruction recognizer and a question-answer coherence evaluator, to assess model behavior across personalized and radicalized outputs. Although the research did not lead to publication, the project significantly deepened my expertise in LLM evaluation, safety, and behavioral alignment.

### üìÑ Foundation-Specific RAG System

Designed and deployed a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for a nonprofit foundation. Built using [Ragbits](https://ragbits.deepsense.ai/), Qdrant, and AWS infrastructure, the solution ingested PDFs directly from the client‚Äôs website and offered scalable deployment via Docker. Included full observability with integrated Jaeger tracing.

### üõ†Ô∏è Ragbits ‚Äì Open Source Contributor

Actively developing [Ragbits](https://ragbits.deepsense.ai/), a modular RAG and agent framework built by Deepsense.ai. My role involves hands-on feature development, code contributions, and providing ongoing feedback to guide functionality improvements and future roadmap decisions based on practical use cases.

### üîó Agent-Based Knowledge API System

Contributing to the development of a function-calling system that integrates LLMs with client APIs to act as an intelligent knowledge base. The solution incorporates principles of Agentic AI, enabling dynamic tool usage and, in the future, autonomous decision-making capabilities. My responsibilities include building custom API integration tools, designing and deploying infrastructure on GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, vector Postgres), and setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab. The system leverages frameworks like LiteLLM and Ragbits to support modular, scalable, and production-ready agentic workflows.
