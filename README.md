## Projects

### 1. \[In Progress] The real estate recommendation in Wroclaw

Academical project which aims to develop a Wroclaw Real Estate Recommendation Tool utilizing big data and deep learning techniques. Key features include transportation analysis to crucial points in the city, property condition classification using CNN, NLP for announcement analysis, and price prediction through regression. PySpark optimization will ensure efficient data processing.


### 2. One period forecasting for BTC-USD API 

This project involves the development of a predictive model utilizing deep learning algorithms to anticipate stock market trends. By analyzing historical data and employing statistical techniques, users can access an API where they can specify preferred methods and select the time steps. Alongside numerical results for each method, the outputs are also presented graphically, enhancing user comprehension and providing a visually appealing interface for better insights.
